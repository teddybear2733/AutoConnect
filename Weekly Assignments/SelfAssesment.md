## Self Assesment - Armen Krikorian
#### My Contribution:
As the sole team member all of the tasks were my responsibility. Broken down into sections though, here are the following contributions I 
made to the project.

1. Research: The first and one of the most important tasks for the project was to research the best way to achive the project that I had invisioned. 
Through many different trial and error steps, I was able to decide on a platform to build my OS and what to use to run the UI. This along with countless
other implementations all had to be reserached before they were chosen as possible solutions to problems.

2. OS: After researching how I was going to create my OS, I then had to go out and actually make it. Figuring out how all the tools worked, creating all of the necessary files to build the OS, and then speding countless hours building it and debugging all of the errors from all of the different drivers.

3. UI: I created the UI layer that is shown to the user that lives on top of the OS layer. To do this I had to choose packages that were compatible
with the OS that I Was creating. I also needed to make sure it worked well with the touchscreen drivers. I had to learn UI design and how to create
apps. I had to create all the images, textures, and colors that were used in the making of the UI along with doing all of the graphical layout and animations.

4. Putting it all together and testing. I had to make sure all parts of the project worked with the other parts of the project. I had to integrate the external apps into my program and then test everything so that I knew that the project was succesfull and that the changes I had made worked.

#### Accomplishments

1. I successfully created a OS that was minimal, quick to boot, stable, and contained all the packages required to the the existing applications and the
ones I created.
2. I created a Python based UI interface that allowed users to interact through the use of a touch screen to launch different applications, change
settings, view files, and see engine data.
3. I created all of the deliverables and the demo for the Senior Design Expo.
4. I have a working version of the project currently running in my own car being used on a daily basis with multiple interested parties in using it.
