## User stories
Three original stories

Story #1: As a user I want to be able to control and modify my cars ECU and diagnostic software, so I can tune them.

Story #2: As a user I want a multimedia interface with my car to interact with, so I can listen to music.

Story #3: As a user I want a to record logs of my engine data, so I can save it off to be further analyzed.

User stories are outlined in the Requirements document that can be found here [Requirements](https://github.com/teddybear2733/AutoConnect/blob/main/Project%20Overview/Requirements.md)

Each of these requirements are individual user stories that are to be completed.
