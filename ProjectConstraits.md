# Project Constraints
## Economic
- Econimic limitations are one of the largest factors in this project. With a very limited project budget
and passsion for the end product to be easily accesible, efficiently creating something for a low cost, whilst maintaining
quakity, to the project team and the end user was a main goal. To accomplish this, the AutoConnect team has made the intentional
decision to levarage OpenSource and popular/universal platforms for its design. This can be seen in the design choice to use 
Raspberry Pi's for the testing/release platform and the opensource tool poky for the development of the OS build.
By creating a fork of the already developed Raspberry Pi software, AutoConnect can save on develpoment costs and make a 
stable product.
## Legal
- Even though this product will not be of a for-purchase, it is still very important that everything create for 
distribution follows the letter of the law. There are many categories the product will fall into, but it is mostly divided into 3.
- There is constraint from the opensource software being utilized. This prevents the product being sold as software directly. 
- Since this is an automotive based product, especially one that could draw attention away from a driver, it is important for it to 
be adhearant to all legal script related to car based entertainment systems while driving.
- This product also features engine tuning and modification capabilities. Some States/Towns have laws against these product so it is
necessary to inform end-users one where the product can and cannot be used.
## Environmental
- AutoConnect will feature software that will allow the end user to modify many parts of their car through software.
This is includes, but is not limited to, engine mapping, boost control, and emmissions regulation. By increasing fuel consuption
and the behavior of the engine, there are environmental conecerns and laws. These will be addressed with notices to users about the impacts of different tunining options based on location of use.
