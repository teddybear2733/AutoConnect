## MileStones

Here are some of the tests that have been completed. A build of base raspian has been made and sucessfully booted. 
A 3d printed case mount was made and was then mounted into a car just to see what the product would look like. It was then connected to the ECU
for a simple readout. Pictures can be found at -> [Pictures](https://github.com/teddybear2733/AutoConnect/tree/main/Artifacts)
