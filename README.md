## Notes

This is a single memeber project so all designs, work, idea and concepts are from just me.

## Code

Since the build files for this project are in the 100s of GB's, only the basic builder code is provided at the moment.
Check out what we've made! -> [Code](https://github.com/teddybear2733/AutoConnect/tree/main/Code)

## MileStones

Here are some of the tests that have been completed. A build of base raspian has been made and sucessfully booted. 
A 3d printed case mount was made and was then mounted into a car just to see what the product would look like. It was then connected to the ECU
for a simple readout. Pictures can be found at -> [Pictures](https://github.com/teddybear2733/AutoConnect/tree/main/Artifacts)
